# A NOTE ON STORED PROCEDURES AND DELIMITERS
#
# Stored procedures and
# functions commonly have nested delimiters that conflict
# with the schema migration parsing.  If you tend to use
# procs, functions, triggers or anything that could create
# this situation, then you may want to experiment with
# send_full_script=true (preferred), or if you can't use
# send_full_script, then you may have to resort to a full
# line delimiter such as "GO" or "/" or "!RUN!".
#
# Also play with the autocommit settings, as some drivers
# or databases don't support creating procs, functions or
# even tables in a transaction, and others require it.
#

# This ignores the line delimiters and
# simply sends the entire script at once.
# Use with JDBC drivers that can accept large
# blocks of delimited text at once.
send_full_script=false

# This controls how statements are delimited.
# By default statements are delimited by an
# end of line semicolon.  Some databases may
# (e.g. MS SQL Server) may require a full line
# delimiter such as GO.
# These are ignored if send_full_script is true.
delimiter=;
full_line_delimiter=false

# If set to true, each statement is isolated
# in its own transaction.  Otherwise the entire
# script is executed in one transaction.
# Few databases should need this set to true,
# but some do.
auto_commit=false

# Custom driver path to allow you to centralize your driver files
# Default requires the drivers to be in the drivers directory of your
# initialized migration directory (created with "migrate init")

# Migrations support variable substitutions in the form of ${variable}
# in the migration scripts.  All of the above properties will be ignored though,
# with the exception of changelog.
# Example: The following would be referenced in a migration file as ${ip_address}
# ip_address=192.168.0.1
